                        Capturing and evolving the richness of life observed on earth in simulation is a long-standing goal of the
                        artificial life field (alife). Recent advances in generative AI have made it possible to create
                        3D meshes of virtual creatures from text prompts. This paper presents a pipeline that
                        leverages these generative models to create a diverse population of 3D creatures, which are
                        then simulated and evolved in a physics-based environment. The pipeline includes three layers of evolution;
                        a prompt-level genotype is mutated to generate a base population, images of creatures are bred together, and finally, 
                        a differentiable simulation environment allows for
                        the co-evolution of creature morphology and control. The results show that the
                        generated creatures exhibit a wide range of morphologies and behaviors. To the best of my knowledge,
                        the first demonstration to leverage generative models for the evolution of virtual creatures in 3D substrates.

These 3D models have received great attention for applications linked to engineering design, but have not yet been leveraged for the study of artificial life. The underlying prior information informing the generative design are datasets of all life on earth and these models are therefore perfectly positioned to generate "Life as it could be". This paper aims to uncover how forms generated by foundation models can be simulated and evolved to learn about general principles.</p>

Open-ended evolution is    <a href="#ref_hughes2024openendednessessentialartificialsuperhuman">[1]</a> that took place on earth, a large body of work focuses on Euclidean spaces of dimension three as they model physical space. Foundation models armed with prior knowledge of our world are able to generate on demand 3D objects representing known and unknown lifeforms.

            <p class="mb-4">On representations. Because the mutations occur in the high-level feature space (via the generative process) rather than direct bit flips, <b>most offspring are valid</b> – a critical requirement for evolvability.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Free-form text prompts as an encoding layer have the advantage of being directly <b>human interpretable</b>, <b>richly descriptive</b> and easily <b>mutable</b> <a href="#ref_guo2025evopromptconnectingllmsevolutionary">[9]</a>, <a href="#ref_Wong_2023">[10]</a>. Prompts have the ability to directly affect the shape of virtual creatures through multiple mechanisms, including global known lifeforms as targets, attribute modifiers as descriptors, etc.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Modern text-to-image generation models have made great strides in 2024–2025. Key advancements include character consistency across images <a href="#ref_tewel2024trainingfreeconsistenttexttoimagegeneration">[11]</a>, fine attribute control <a href="#ref_brooks2023instructpix2pixlearningfollowimage">[12]</a>, editability, and high resolution <a href="#ref_podell2023sdxlimprovinglatentdiffusion">[13]</a>, all of which help maintain coherence and precision as evolved creatures are visualized.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">2025 has seen a burst of tools and models for image-to-3D reconstruction <a href="#ref_tochilkin2024triposrfast3dobject">[14]</a> and text-to-3D synthesis <a href="#ref_zhu2024hifahighfidelitytextto3dgeneration">[15]</a>. These developments enable a prompt-to-3D pipeline: a prompt produces an image (the creature’s appearance) and then AI lifts that into a 3D mesh for use in virtual worlds or physics simulations. Fast Single-Image Reconstruction: feed-forward pass under 0.5 seconds. Significantly better 3D quality from text prompts. Large focus on usable, animation-ready geometry as well as Clean and Watertight Mesh Generation.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">A grand challenge is to reverse-engineer function from that form. Affordance and Mobility Inference: A line of recent work in computer vision and robotics focuses on understanding the affordances of 3D objects. For example, in the context of scenes, methods now can identify articulating parts and how they move (doors that rotate, drawers that slide, etc.) <a href="#ref_53213">[16]</a>. In our example, for DiffAqua, we might want to detect and animate fish parts.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Translating this to evolved creatures: if we generate a creature mesh, we could apply similar techniques to predict joint locations (e.g. identify limb segments and likely hinge points at knees or shoulders). The model might recognize “this looks like a leg that could bend here” or “these wings probably flap along this edge.” Such an automatic rigging or motion inference is still in early stages, but the components are emerging. At a simpler level, just classifying the creature’s morphology (does it have legs? wings? wheels?) can inform what type of movement to attempt. This is analogous to how a human seeing a fantastical creature might guess “it seems to have fins, so maybe it swims.” By leveraging large datasets of 3D objects with known functions (e.g. Shape2Motion dataset for articulated objects), one can train models to extend those predictions to new, AI-generated forms.</p>

            <h4 class="text-lg font-medium mt-4 mb-2">2.1.1. Advances in Text-to-Image Synthesis</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">Text-to-image (T2I) synthesis has seen remarkable progress, largely driven by diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion <a href="#ref_rombach2022highresolutionimagesynthesislatent">[22]</a>, DALL-E <a href="#ref_ramesh2021zeroshottexttoimagegeneration">[23]</a>, and Imagen <a href="#ref_saharia2022photorealistictexttoimagediffusionmodels">[24]</a>. These models can generate high-quality, diverse images from textual prompts. A key area of development is Visual Concept Mining (VCM) <a href="#ref_li2025comprehensivesurveyvisualconcept">[25]</a>, which aims to enhance the controllability of T2I models by allowing them to learn specific visual concepts (e.g., artistic styles, object features) from reference images, complementing textual inputs. This improved controllability is crucial for generating specific and consistent visual features for virtual creatures.</p>
            <h4 class="text-lg font-medium mt-4 mb-2">2.1.2. From 2D Images to 3D Models</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">Bridging the gap from 2D images to 3D models is a critical step. Current research in diffusion models for 3D generation  can be broadly classified into three categories: 2D space diffusion leveraging pretrained 2D models, 2D space diffusion without pretrained models, and diffusion processes operating directly in 3D space <a href="#ref_placeholder1">[P1]</a>.</p>
            <p>Techniques like DreamFusion <a href="#ref_placeholder1">[P1]</a> and Score Jacobian Chaining <a href="#ref_placeholder1">[P1]</a> utilize pretrained 2D diffusion models to optimize 3D representations (often Neural Radiance Fields, NeRFs) by scoring rendered 2D views. Image-to-3D mesh generation tools like Trellis <a href="#ref_placeholder2">[P2]</a>, employed in this work, aim to produce explicit mesh representations directly. Trellis and similar models <a href="#ref_placeholder1">[P1]</a> represent a scalable route to 3D assets, though challenges such as the "Janus problem" (multi-view inconsistency) persist and are active areas of research <a href="#ref_placeholder1">[P1]</a>. Efficient alternatives like DreamGaussian also contribute to this rapidly evolving field <a href="#ref_placeholder1">[P1]</a>, <a href="#ref_hsinying2025consistentsubjectgenerationcontrastive">[26]</a>.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">DiffAqua is <a href="#ref_Ma_2021">[27]</a> is the chosen platform for this work as it provides a differentiable pipeline for the co-design of soft underwater swimmer geometries and their controllers. Its differentiability allows for efficient gradient-based optimization.

            <h4 class="text-lg font-medium mt-4 mb-2">3.2.3. Step 3: Mesh Adaptation for Simulation (DiffAqua)</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">This step is critical for translating the raw 3D mesh into a format suitable for the DiffAqua soft body physics simulator. This involves voxelization and the definition of actuation (muscles).</p>
            <p class="mb-2"><b>Voxelization:</b> The mesh generated by Trellis is converted into a voxel-based representation. Method: A uniform grid voxelization approach is typically employed, though adaptive methods could be explored. Standard libraries or custom scripts can perform this conversion. The resolution of the voxel grid is a key parameter, balancing simulation fidelity against computational cost. General literature on voxelization from images provides context for this process.</p>
            <p class="mb-2"><b>Muscle Placement / Actuator Definition:</b> Defining how the creature is actuated is crucial for assessing its function. Automation Challenge: The automation and intelligence of this "muscle placement" step are of paramount importance for a truly AI-driven design pipeline. If this requires significant manual intervention, it becomes a bottleneck. Current Approach (Hypothesized based on user input): An automated or heuristic-based method is used to place actuators on the voxelized creature. This could involve:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 ml-4 space-y-1">
                <li>Identifying prominent appendages or regions of the body from the geometry.</li>
                <li>Using simple rules (e.g., placing actuators along the main axis for undulation, or within limb-like structures).</li>
                <li>Potentially deriving cues from the initial prompt (e.g., "powerful flippers" might suggest actuator placement in flipper-like regions).</li>

We shall measure the distribution of these sizes $P(s)$ in the Artificial Life system Avida, which implements a population of self-replicating computer programs written in a simple machine language-like instruction set of $\mathcal{D}=24$ instructions, with programs of varying sequence length. In the course of self-replication, these programs produce mutant off-spring because the `copy` instruction they use is flawed at a rate $R$ errors per instruction copied, and adapt to an environment in which the performance of <i>logical</i> computations on externally provided numbers is akin to the catalysis of chemical reactions <a href="#ref_OBA">[36]</a>. In this <i>artificial chemistry</i> therefore, successful computations accelerate the metabolism (i.e., the CPU) of those strings that carry the <i>gene</i> (code) necessary to perform the trick, and any program discovering a new trick is the seed of another avalanche.</p>

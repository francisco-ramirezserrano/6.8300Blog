# Project Title (Replace with Your Project's Title)

This project makes use of interactive "fish viewers." Due to file hosting limitations on GitHub for this specific content, the `fish_viewers` directory needs to be downloaded separately.

## Setup Instructions

To run this project correctly, you need to download the `fish_viewers` folder and place it inside of the main project folder (referred to here as the "blog template folder"). You wont regret it! ðŸ˜‰

### 1. Download `fish_viewers` Folder

The `fish_viewers` folder, containing the necessary HTML files for the interactive animations, can be downloaded from Google Drive:

* **Download Link:** [Download `fish_viewers` (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R6Q1BCfbbs-mjhPv8KFMCn9Cc-5CuQUD/view?usp=sharing)

**Important:** Please ensure this Google Drive link is set to "Anyone with the link can view" or a similar permission that allows public access for downloading the file/folder.

### 2. Place the Folder

Once downloaded (it might be a ZIP file, so extract it first if needed), you should have a folder named `fish_viewers`.

* Place this entire `fish_viewers` folder directly into the **root** of your "blog template folder" (the main directory of this specific project/blog).
